	"concept": "How does your Mythos adapt to the circumstances?",
	"desc": "Mortal life is in a constant state of flux and change: nothing is permanent, everything is ephemeral. Different challenges require entirely different means to overcome. Some Mythoi grant their Rifts the power to adapt to circumstance. Do they consciously do this to improve the Rift’s chances of telling their story? Or is it simply the case because their story is a story of resourcefulness and limitless possibilities to begin with? It is impossible to know.\n\nThe aboriginal Mythos of Dreamtime could allow its Rift to tap into the dimension underlying creation and bend reality. Merlin the sorcerer could whip out a spell to tackle any situation. A shaman could shapeshift into animals and monsters. A doppleganger could mimic the powers of other Rifts it touches. And Pinocchio's father, Geppetto, could build toys and puppets that come to life. \n\nAdaption themes gravitate towards broad tags by nature and so often take up the single broad tag allowed for your character (see Broad vs. Specific Tags, page 110). However, if the variety of effects granted by this theme is rather narrow, such as the doppelganger, who can only copy existing powers, the MC may rule that a tag still qualifies as specific.",

If you then have any remaining Clues in the same batch, you can convert them to Juice, one for one, and use it to come up with the thing you need most. This Juice has the same method as the Clues it came from.",
		"Creative Stroke": "When you use tags from this theme in a creative way, choose one of the most affected characters and ask whoever is playing it (the MC or another player) whether they saw it coming. They must answer honestly. If they didn’t, take a temporary status creative-stroke-1 (or similar).",
