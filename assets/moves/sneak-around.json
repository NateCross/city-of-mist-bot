The MC chooses 1:\n\n- Someone unimportant noticed you, but that just made them important, right?\n\n- You are perceived only by a secondary sense (someone picks up your scent while you’re stalking them; you’re seen whispering a message but the message is not heard).\n\n- You must leave something important behind – or be discovered."
