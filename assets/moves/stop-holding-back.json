On a hit, you achieve exactly what you wanted to achieve and pay the price: \n- Significant: On a 7-9. mark Fade/Crack, and burn all the power tags on one theme. On a 10+, mark Fade/Crack on one theme. \n- No Return: On a 7-9, replace one theme. One a 10+, mark Fade/Crack and burn all the power tags on one theme. \n- Ultimate: On a 7-9, you are killed, destroyed, or transformed forever(for now). Take a tier-6 status. You cannot Face Danger. On a 10+, replace one theme. \n- On a 6 or less, you pay the price given for 7-9, but you also lose control over your powers or fail to use them as planned. The MC will decide how, and what the consequences are."
